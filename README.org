* Features

* Dependencies
The video-to-ascii conversion script uses [[https://github.com/ivanl-exe/image-to-ascii/][image-to-ascii]] for the conversion in the background.
It is assumed to be located on the same height as this project and that it is build in release-mode (due to performance).

* TODO
- [ ] Add README Stuff
- [ ] Rewrite ascii conversion in Rust (with an own impl of ascii-to-text)
